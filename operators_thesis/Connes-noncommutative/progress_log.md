# Connes Noncommutative Geometry Approach - Progress Log

## Mission
Develop Alain Connes' noncommutative geometry approach to the Riemann Hypothesis through theory, implementation, testing, and documentation.

## Key Insight from Framework
The RIEMANN_HYPOTHESIS_GEN_APPROACH.md provides three approaches:
1. Categorical Factorization (Gen framework)
2. Spectral Self-Organization (Hilbert-Pólya)
3. Information-Theoretic (Max entropy)

Connes' approach fits within Strategy 2: Finding the Hermitian operator H such that its eigenvalues correspond to Riemann zeros.

## Connes' Core Ideas
- Noncommutative geometry provides the right framework
- Trace formula connects spectral properties to zeros
- The critical line Re(s)=1/2 emerges naturally from operator structure
- Key: H = (1/2)I + iT where T encodes prime number structure

## Implementation Plan
1. Theory: Develop mathematical framework for trace formula approach
2. Code: Implement finite-dimensional approximations
3. Test: Validate against known zeros
4. Document: Analyze results and gaps
